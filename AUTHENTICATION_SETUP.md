2. The admin panel will only load with the correct access key
3. **Change the access key** in `src/App.tsx` for security:
   ```typescript
   // In ProtectedAdmin component, change 'owner2024' to your own key
   if (adminKey === 'your-secret-key-here') {
   ```

### **Admin Features:**
- Add new products to the store
- Edit existing product details
- Delete products from inventory
- Real-time updates to the shop page
- Product management with images, colors, sizes, prices

## Security Rules Update (Optional)

For enhanced security, you can update your Firestore rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Products: anyone can read, authenticated users can write
    match /products/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Customer profiles: only the owner can read/write their own data
    match /customers/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Orders: only the customer can read their own orders
    match /orders/{document} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.customerUid;
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Auth domain not configured"**: Make sure you've enabled Authentication in Firebase Console

2. **"Email already in use"**: This email is already registered - try signing in instead

3. **"Weak password"**: Password must be at least 6 characters

4. **"Invalid email"**: Check email format

5. **"User not found"**: Email not registered - try signing up first

6. **Admin access denied**: Make sure you're using the correct access key in the URL

2. **Login**: Sign in with the account
